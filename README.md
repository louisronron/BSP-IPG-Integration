# BSP IPG Integration
I thought it best to document a few things regarding the Internet Payment Gateway (IPG) Integration with Bank South Pacific just for future reference. This does not aim to be a formal documentation, but just a collection of my thoughts on the subject.

## First Contact
My first contact with BSP's was when working with Be Pacific Digital Agency, on a particular website project for *East Street Fitness*. We were under the leadership of Belinda Manning (A top executive of Bank South Pacific) which made it very easy to liase with her BSP team regarding any integration assistance. That particular project gave me the exposure to the documentation, and the whole nature of building e-commerce platforms. As I write this, PNG is in its infancy of the roll-out of IPG solutions for businesses especially in the MSME market. In this first contact of the IPG, I gained a fair understanding of all the pieces and how they play together.
